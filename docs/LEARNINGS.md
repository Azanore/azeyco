# Learning Notes

This document is for tracking new concepts learned, useful resources found, and mistakes made during the project.

- **New concepts learned:**

  - Layered documentation strategy (main doc as index, detailed docs in separate files)
  - Modular backend structure with clear separation of concerns
  - Reference documentation for quick navigation and dependency management
  - JSDoc commenting standards for backend functions
  - Prompt system design for AI-assisted development
  - Documentation coherence strategies for maintainable projects

- **Useful resources:**

  - Express.js middleware setup and configuration
  - Mongoose database connection patterns
  - Environment variable management with dotenv
  - Markdown documentation organization patterns

- **Mistakes/lessons:**
  - Documentation should be planned for scalability from the start
  - Reference files are crucial for maintaining large codebases
  - Clear separation between architectural decisions and implementation details
  - Prompts must be updated to match actual documentation structure
  - Quick file tags are essential for efficient context switching
